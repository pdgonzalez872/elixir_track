# Elixir Track for Code Platoon

## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to offer a starting point in the
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language for students.


## Exercises:

For a given exercise in the Code Platoon curriculum (found as a repository
[here](https://github.com/CodePlatoon)) we will:

- use [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) if the exercise exists there
- create a folder in this repository for the exercise and provide a test
  structure, similar to what exists for the other languages Code Platoon
  supports. Instructions for the exercises will be within the folder's
  README.md file.
